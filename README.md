# Crawl4AI Web Scraper MCP Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <!-- Optional: Add license -->

This project provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that uses the **[crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)** library to perform web scraping and intelligent content extraction tasks. It allows AI agents (like Claude, or agents built with LangChain/LangGraph) to interact with web pages, retrieve content, search for specific text, and perform LLM-based extraction based on natural language instructions.

This server uses:

*   **[FastMCP](https://github.com/model-context-protocol/mcp-py/blob/main/docs/fastmcp.md):** For creating the MCP server endpoint.
*   **[crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai):** For the core web crawling and extraction logic.
*   **[dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv):** For managing API keys via a `.env` file.
*   **(Optional) Docker:** For containerized deployment, bundling Python and dependencies.

## Features

*   Exposes MCP tools for web interaction:
    *   `scrape_url`: Get the full content of a webpage in Markdown format.
    *   `extract_text_by_query`: Find specific text snippets on a page based on a query.
    *   `smart_extract`: Use an LLM (currently Google Gemini) to extract structured information based on instructions.
*   Configurable via environment variables (API keys).
*   Includes Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`) for easy, self-contained deployment.
*   Communicates over Server-Sent Events (SSE) on port 8002 by default.

## Exposed MCP Tools

### `scrape_url`

Scrape a webpage and return its content in Markdown format.

**Arguments:**

*   `url` (str, **required**): The URL of the webpage to scrape.

**Returns:**

*   (str): The webpage content in Markdown format, or an error message.

### `extract_text_by_query`

Extract relevant text snippets from a webpage that contain a specific search query. Returns up to the first 5 matches found.

**Arguments:**

*   `url` (str, **required**): The URL of the webpage to search within.
*   `query` (str, **required**): The text query to search for (case-insensitive).
*   `context_size` (int, *optional*): The number of characters to include before and after the matched query text in each snippet. Defaults to `300`.

**Returns:**

*   (str): A formatted string containing the found text snippets or a message indicating no matches were found, or an error message.

### `smart_extract`

Intelligently extract specific information from a webpage using the configured LLM (currently requires Google Gemini API key) based on a natural language instruction.

**Arguments:**

*   `url` (str, **required**): The URL of the webpage to analyze and extract from.
*   `instruction` (str, **required**): Natural language instruction specifying what information to extract (e.g., "List all the speakers mentioned on this page", "Extract the main contact email address", "Summarize the key findings").

**Returns:**

*   (str): The extracted information (often formatted as JSON or structured text based on the instruction) or a message indicating no relevant information was found, or an error message (including if the required API key is missing).

## Setup and Running

You can run this server either locally or using the provided Docker configuration.

### Option 1: Running with Docker (Recommended for Deployment)

This method bundles Python and all necessary libraries. You only need Docker installed on the host machine.

1.  **Install Docker:** Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your OS. Start Docker Desktop.
2.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Create `.env` File:** Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add your API keys:
    ```.env
    # Required for the smart_extract tool
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
    # MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key_here(Don't need this for now)
    ```
4.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t crawl4ai-mcp-server .
    ```
5.  **Run the Container:** This starts the server, making port 8002 available on your host machine. It uses `--env-file` to securely pass the API keys from your local `.env` file into the container's environment.
    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -p 8002:8002 --env-file .env crawl4ai-mcp-server
    ```
    *   `-it`: Runs interactively.
    *   `--rm`: Removes container on exit.
    *   `-p 8002:8002`: Maps host port 8002 to container port 8002.
    *   `--env-file .env`: Loads environment variables from your local `.env` file into the container. **Crucial for API keys.**
    *   `crawl4ai-mcp-server`: The name of the image you built.
6.  **Server is Running:** Logs will appear, indicating the server is listening on SSE (`http://0.0.0.0:8002`).
7.  **Connecting Client:** Configure your MCP client (e.g., LangChain agent) to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8002/sse` with `transport: "sse"`.

### Option 2: Running Locally

This requires Python and manual installation of dependencies on your host machine.

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure Python >= 3.9 (check `crawl4ai` requirements if needed, 3.10+ recommended).
2.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    ```
    *(Or use Conda: `conda create --name crawl4ai-env python=3.11 -y && conda activate crawl4ai-env`)*
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Create `.env` File:** Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add your API keys (same content as in Docker setup step 3).
6.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    python your_server_script_name.py # e.g., python webcrawl_mcp_server.py
    ```
7.  **Server is Running:** It will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:8002/sse`.
8.  **Connecting Client:** Configure your MCP client to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8002/sse`.

## Environment Variables

The server uses the following environment variables, typically loaded from an `.env` file:

*   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: **Required** for the `smart_extract` tool to function (uses Google Gemini). Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Checked for existence but **not currently used** by any tool in this version.
*   `MISTRAL_API_KEY`: Checked for existence but **not currently used** by any tool in this version.

## Example Agent Interaction

{
  "main_points": [
    "Gemini is Google's most capable AI model family (Ultra, Pro, Nano).",
    "Designed to be multimodal, understanding text, code, audio, image, video.",
